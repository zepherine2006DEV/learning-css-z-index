## Learning Points

### Semantic naming of CSS classes.

Name CSS classes to describe the content it applies to or the purpose, but not literally what it looks like. Always ask why?

red-text - bad
blue-button - bad
border-4px  - bad
large-text - bad (why large)

alert - good
message-error - good
stand-out - good

Methodologies such as BEM (Block Element Modifier)
