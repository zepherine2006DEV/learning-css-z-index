# Learning z index (layers) in CSS

This simple learning project explors layers and z index in html, as well as giving me chance to improve my css class naming.  

I've also used it as an opportunity to improve my productivity by using only keyboard shortcuts in the editor (VS Code) and also learning a little about Emmet, so that I can create boilerplate code more quickly.

## User Stories

As a developer,  
I want to have a large square sandwiched between two small squares, with the the small squares offset.  
So that I can understand how z index works in css.  

As a developer,
I want to understand best practice for using classes.
So that I organise my css and make it easier to read.  

## How to Use

## Learning Points

### Semantic naming of CSS classes.

Name CSS classes to describe the content it applies to or the purpose, but not literally what it looks like. Always ask why?

red-text - bad
blue-button - bad
border-4px  - bad
large-text - bad (why is the text large?)

alert - good
message-error - good
stand-out - good

Methodologies such as BEM (Block Element Modifier) can also be used.
